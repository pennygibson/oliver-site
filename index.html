				<p>Oliver  Chard  is  an  artist  based  in  Winnipeg,  Manitoba  who  has  also  lived  and  practiced  in  the  UK  and  Denmark.  He  divides  his  time  between  his  practice  as  a  sculptor  and  artistic  production  in  the  film  industry.  He  studied  sculpture  at  Emily  Carr  University  where  his  interest  shifted  towards  the  literal  and  the  figurative.  After  making  a  tour  of  the  European  wax  anatomical  collections,  especially  those  at  La  Specola  in  Florence  and  the  Josephinum  in  Vienna,  he  has  experimented  with  wax  as  a  medium  that  allows  him  to  work  between  realism  and  the  surreal.  Recently  he  has  been  experimenting  with  concrete  as  a  casting  medium.</p>
